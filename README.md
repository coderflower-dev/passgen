This is a command line tool please run it from the console.

### <code style="color : red">!!</code> Please note the updated license <code style="color : red">!!</code> (If you forked before 1/3/2024 you still use the MIT license)<br>
The license is a modified FreeBSD license, basically you have to give credit to using this software, and you cannot claim that you made it, and you must state if you modified it.

## Purpose:
Generates a password (I don't know if it is trustable)

Run `build_win.bat` for Windows<br>
Run `build_unix.sh` for Unix/MacOS

### Version 2.1 now has:
-Command line arguments. Type the use case for the password, then the use case and the password will be stored in `passwords.txt`<br>
-Type `--nosave` if you do not want to save the password in a text file (Not tested)
