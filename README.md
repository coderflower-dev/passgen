# passgen
Generates a random (ish) password.<br>
This is a command line tool please run it from the console.

!! Please note the updated license !! (If you forked before 1/3/2024 you still use the MIT license)<br>
The license is a modified FreeBSD license, basically you have to give credit to using this software, and you cannot claim that you made it.

## Purpose:
Generates a password (I don't know if it is trustable)

Run `build_win.bat` for Windows<br>
Run `build_unix.sh` for Unix/MacOS

### V2 now has:
-Command line arguments, run the program and type the name of the place where you use it (just easier to remember)
-Saves passwords in `passwords.txt`
-Example `passgen google` -> Google {password} in `passwords.txt`
