# passgen
Generates a random (ish) password.

This is a command line tool please run it from the console.

## Purpose:
Generates a password (I don't know if it is trustable)

Run `build_win.bat` for Windows

Run `build_unix.sh` for Unix/MacOS

### V2 now has:
-Command line arguments, run the program and type the name of the place where you use it (just easier to remember)
-Saves passwords in `passwords.txt`
-Example `passgen google" -> Google {password} in `passwords.txt`
