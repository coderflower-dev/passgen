### <code style="color : red">!!</code> Please note the updated license <code style="color : red">!!</code> (If you forked before 1/3/2024 you still use the MIT license)<br>
The license is a modified FreeBSD license, basically you have to give credit to using this software, and you cannot claim that you made it, and you must state if you modified it.
